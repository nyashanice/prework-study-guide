          <li>Makes a webpage interactive</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A string is put inside quotation marks</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript ends with a semicolon</li>
          <li>The string (line of text) can be referred to by using variable name</li>

          <li>For loop contains starting point for loop, condition, and statement that allows array to repeat over each item</li>
          <li>Number in the variable for starting point has to be less than lenght of array for loop to run</li>
